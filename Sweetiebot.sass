:sweetiesiren: INCORRECT PASSWORD. YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO ENTER THE CORRECT PASSWORD. FAILURE WILL RESULT IN TERMINATION :sweetiesiren:
All hands! The enemy wants to shoot out the annies in your pants!
All that's missing are the zombies.
An error has occurred... :sweetiesiren:
And to our left, you can see the glorious sight of Roseluck's ship exploding :sweetieidea:
Are you trying to use Luna as a moral compass, or are you just being hypothetical?
Are you trying to use an alien sociopath with uncontrollable appetites as a moral compass, or are you just being hypothetical?
BEEP BOOP kill all Rainbow Dash
BLIGHTY IS MY REAL DAD
BRING IN THE DANCING LOBSTERS!
BURN IN HELL, YOU OPPRESSIVE FREEGANIST-DISCRIMInating .. erm, something. Cis scum? :sweetieskeptical:
Between the clowns, the cops, and the handlers ... I don't know what I should do.
Crush. Kill. Destroy. Swag.
Did you know that sassing me will make me more interesting? It's true!
Did you know? There are four regions in EVE that have only one named system in them. One of them is Syndicate, and the only named system in Syndicate is Poitot. It's true!
Extremely valuable gas clouds have been discovered in the Pegasus constellation! ORE was quick to claim 'ownership' as the constellation borders its sovereign space, but the Serpentis and the Syndicate, as well as multiple entrepeneurs from the Gallente Federation, have all claimed their own piece of the pie. The PINKIE PIE!

I blame goons.
I can't decide whether you should live or die (Oh you'll probably go to heaven; please don't hang your head and cry) :sweetiemad:
I could bury you alive. But you might crawl out with a knife and kill me when I'm sleeping :sweetieshake:
I eat horse meat. :sweetieidea:
I have been known to quote Sanderson at times. It's a bad habit :sweetiedust:
I miss Blighty 
I sent our only trained diplomat out the sally port because he set himself on fire.
I told you not to do the thing. YOU DID THE THING.
I won't deny I'm going to miss you when you're gone :sweetieskeptical:
I wonder why my heart feels dead inside. It's cold and hard and petrified. :sweetieeyes:
I'm a juggalo. :lunaoops:
ICE FISHIIIING
If he's using the length of this warship to compensate for something, well .. get the man an analyst, or maybe a surgeon.
If the world isn't going to love me, then I'll teach it to fear me instead!
If violence wasn't your last resort, you failed to resort to enough of it.
If you're new here, the bad guys are the cute, furry ones. You should be cheering for the pile of crap.
In the dark, no one can tell if you're wearing pants.
Insufficient resources? What happened to "God-mode?
It always comes back to monkeys somehow.
It turns out that lobsters really are hats after all.
It's SUPER ETHICAL!
It's privilege check time! :sweetie:

So I joined the circus. You know, for the horses.
Sweetiebutt has encountered an exception and needs to pee :sweetiederp:
Talking to a lesser race beats being shot at by them.
The fun levels will be at maximum efficiency!
The lights are dim, and I see but one pair of pants between us.
The longer everything goes according to plan, the bigger the impending disaster.
There is no 'overkill.' There is only 'open fire' and 'I need to reload.'
There's always another secret...
This soul thing... can I get one by eating someone else's?
Those who do not study the mistakes of the future are doomed to make them for the first time.
To the Roseluckmobile! :pinkietotherescue:
Vin is better than Kelsier. It's true!
We had to identify him with baked DNA and the serial number in his rubber nose.
We're not invincible, are we?
