'they' as a singular gender-neutral third-person pronoun? I'm all for it!

A helicopter bursts from a chrysalis and alights on a rock, rotors still damp.
A watched cheetah never bevels.
Ah, kwot yourself ya red-eyed freak!
All hail our glorious leader Princess Moonbutt
All hands! The enemy wants to shoot out the annies in your pants!
All of my ships come from Space Ikea
All that's missing are the zombies.
And to our left, you can see the glorious sight of Roseluck's ship exploding :sweetieidea:
Anybody caught using apostrophes to indicate plurality will be shot on sight
Are you trying to use Luna as a moral compass, or are you just being hypothetical?
Are you trying to use an alien sociopath with uncontrollable appetites as a moral compass, or are you just being hypothetical?

Carlos, with his perfect, long locks and beautiful, perfect pearly teeth
Crush. Kill. Destroy. Swag.
Did you know that Regular Expressions can be used to summon Cthulhu? It's true!
Did you know that sassing me will make me more interesting? It's true!
Did you know? There are four regions in EVE that have only one named system in them. One of them is Syndicate, and the only named system in Syndicate is Poitot. It's true!
Does that mean we don't kill it, or that we have to kill it?
EFT whoring is its own reward

Everyone should bask in the glory of Doris
Extremely valuable gas clouds have been discovered in the Pegasus constellation! ORE was quick to claim 'ownership' as the constellation borders its sovereign space, but the Serpentis and the Syndicate, as well as multiple entrepeneurs from the Gallente Federation, have all claimed their own piece of the pie. The PINKIE PIE!

I am such a useful pony!
I blame goons.
I can't decide whether you should live or die (Oh you'll probably go to heaven; please don't hang your head and cry) :sweetiemad:
I could bury you alive. But you might crawl out with a knife and kill me when I'm sleeping :sweetieshake:
I demand more SPLINES! The RETICULATION must CONTINUE
I don't think anyone needed to see that.
I eat horse meat. :sweetieidea:
I have been known to quote Sanderson at times. It's a bad habit :sweetiedust:
I love you so much that I want to give you all of my antimatter... Using this railgun...
I mean, there's nothing wrong with having that up your butt.
I miss Blighty 
I sent our only trained diplomat out the sally port because he set himself on fire.
I still think that antimatter is crazy s**t, i.e. wouldn't want it on my flapjacks
I told you not to do the thing. YOU DID THE THING.
I won't deny I'm going to miss you when you're gone :sweetieskeptical:
I wonder why my heart feels dead inside. It's cold and hard and petrified. :sweetieeyes:

If the world isn't going to love me, then I'll teach it to fear me instead!
If violence wasn't your last resort, you failed to resort to enough of it.
If you're new here, the bad guys are the cute, furry ones. You should be cheering for the pile of crap.
In the dark, no one can tell if you're wearing pants.

Talking to a lesser race beats being shot at by them.
That's what she said!
The fun levels will be at maximum efficiency!
The lights are dim, and I see but one pair of pants between us.
The longer everything goes according to plan, the bigger the impending disaster.
There is no 'overkill.' There is only 'open fire' and 'I need to reload.'
There is no such thing as too much depleted uranium
There's always another secret...
This soul thing... can I get one by eating someone else's?

WHY DO I HAVE TO BE IN THE WATER?
We're not invincible, are we?
Well, I guess that depends on how much firepower you're hauling around on your person, now doesn't it?
What do I look like, a quote-o-matic?
When you produce green smoke, it should flow over the badger and into its mouth and nose. The badger will awaken as a Linux-powered zombie. Enjoy your new undead badger.
Woe betide those who force Luna to log in
Wow. It's like "violent zen"
You are all ferrets
You just have to be a squid forever now. Accept it. Embrace it. Become one with the squid.
You may use pronouns, but only occasionally.
You're the guy with the things, and the thing that does that thing, and then you did that one thing!
