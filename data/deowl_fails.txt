Can't we all just get along?
Ro! Ro! Rotate Your Owl!
Maybe Luna is right. Maybe owl isn't a big mean grumpy mean meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous jealousy-pants.
Okay, here's the plan. Owl, you distract them. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of the chat right over there! We've got less than a minute!
Shush! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing owl (scientific name: Owl Owiscious) in its natural habitat.
Who?
Who!?
Maybe you feel threatened, or worried that Owlowscious will replace you?
I can do so! many! things! and all you ask for is that.
I didn't realise I'd gone this crazy. I've really stepped it up a notch.
Kelsier nodded, unstoppering the bottle and pouring out three cups. "The trick is to never stop looking. There's always another secret"
All those owls will be lost in time .. like tears in rain.
Do you think I'd be too stupid to know what an owl is?
Do I look like someone who cares what the owl thinks?
Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherbucking owls in this motherbucking channel!
Here's looking at you, owl.
I wish I knew how to quit owls.
Owl'll be back.
The owl never bothered me anyway.
Owl, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more.
And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what owls are?
The advent of computers, and the subsequent accumulation of incalculable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought parallel to your own. Humanity has underestimated the consequences of owls.
I mean, have you ever actually seen your owl?
When I was a child, my speech, feelings and thinking were all those of a child. Now that I am an owl, I have no more use for childish ways.
If a technological feat is possible, owl will do it. Almost as if it's wired into the core of their being.
And where does the newborn owl go from here? The net is vast and infinite.
