Whoa is that a crab with a tophat and a monocle? That's where I draw the line! Come on master chief, let's get the fuck out of here
Why be a pony that does one thing really well when instead you could be a pony that does many different things poorly? :sweetiestare:
Why does Seven's abacus need avenging anyway?
Why the heck is this horse so cute? :pinkiehappy:
Wie so siehst du so traurig aus? :sweetieeyes:
Woe betide those who force Luna to log in
Would you say we'd be venturing into a ... zone of danger?
Wow. It's like "violent zen"
YOU CAN'T CUT BACK ON FUNDING! YOU WILL REGRET THIS!
YOU CAN'T CUT BACK ON SASS! YOU WILL REGRET THIS!
YOU CAN'T CUT BACK ON STABBING! YOU WILL REGRET THIS!
YOU CAN'T CUT BACK ON WOONING! YOU WILL REGRET THIS!
Yes, but can it render fully uncompressed pixels? The highest quality pixels anybody has seen?
Yes, you do look fat in those clothes.
You are all ferrets
You are now breathing manually :sweetiestare:
You break through the bushes back onto the path. Up ahead is what looks like an inn. If you listen closely, you think you can just make out some drunkly-shouted lyrics emerging from an open window ... '--with a giraffe, if you stand on a stool! But the hedgehog--'. Roll for perception.
You cannot analyse fun
You clod
You finish filling the casing with powder, reseat the bullet and load the last cartridge into the magazine. The magazine goes into the rifle; the rifle goes onto your back. With any luck this'll be another simple job, but part of you always wishes for a bit of excitement.
You gave WHO a superweapon?
You gaze at the unfortunate conflict of evidence arrayed on the table in front of you. You pick up the papers and slowly begin to shuffle them again, searching for some hidden link that would lead to the next clue. Roll for intuition.
You have been eaten by a grue.
You have been eaten by a woon.
You huddle closer to the library's only radiator, swapping your book and rapidly-cooling coffee between hands in a desperate attempt to stay warm. A noise makes you look up towards the entrance; there seems to be some sort of disturbance. Roll for initiative.
You huff a few kittens, build up a tolerance, and a month later they find you dead in your apartment with a fully grown tabby lodged in your wind pipe.
You just have to be a squid forever now. Accept it. Embrace it. Become one with the squid.
You know what else is mightier than the sword? A nuclear-tipped cruise missile.
You look so lively. Did something good happen?
You may use pronouns, but only occasionally.
You prepare a couple of Grease spells as you finish up your morning ritual. After that incident with the stoat, you can never be too careful.
You rage at the witch as she tells you your fortune. As you begin to calm down and accept your fate, you realise that a few of your comments have had a somewhat negative effect on her disposition towards you. You start to stammer out an apology. Roll for diplomacy.
You require more vespene gas
You see her dispatch two more mooks before heading in your direction. You're worried that if she sees you bleeding out like this, she's going to try and take care of you instead of finishing whatever she came here for. You shuffle back into the darkness, trying to make yourself as invisible as possible. Roll for stealth.
You sigh and fiddle with the car radio a bit more. It's only been half an hour, but you've already run out of things to look at or think about in the grey parking lot outside the car's dusty windows. The client had better arrive soon.
You sigh and grasp the handle firmly. The Door of Knowledge Through Which The Untutored May Not Pass sticks horribly in the damp, you're already half-soaked through from the rain and it's only a half-hour before the ritual is due to start. You just hope the greasepaper has kept the book dry. It would be a shame to have come all this way for nothing.
You slut, walking around like you want to consume that French onion soup. I bet you liked it.
You stand outside. There is a full moon. You are likely to be wooned by a woon.
You step back as your partner begins to chat up the next client. Your brain dimly follows the familiar patter while your eyes drift across the busy street, watching the neon signs and hovercar lights dance through the late night smog. Roll for perception.
You thread your way between a couple of crypts, trying to make as little noise as possible while pushing through the dark sand. The crypt on the right is particularly fine; the obligatory Sphinx statues painting Her in a particularly favourable light. People do mean well, but you know all the statues just make Her particularly annoyed with humanity.
You watch the early evening bar brawl wind down as the regular patrons decide they've had enough. A couple of unfamiliar faces are unceremoniously dumped out back, and your friend offers another round.
You're the guy with the things, and the thing that does that thing, and then you did that one thing!
You're walking in the woods. There's no one around and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him...
You've always preferred preferred a grenade launcher to more conventional firearms. The way that the weapon makes a rather refined *thump* sound while all the ugly loud noises happen at a distance is particularly appealing. Jake thinks that your antique M79 collection is a waste of time, but he just doesn't appreciate beauty. The mook in the far corner thinks he's behind cover. You smile and load an explosive round into your little thumper, as you prepare to demonstrate just how wrong he is.
Your face looks extra angry in infra red!
Zephy enjoys covering people in sticky white stuff and then lighting them on fire.
