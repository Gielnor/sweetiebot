bot should be the abstraction layer for all things jabber-related
modules should just operate on pure text and value types
we'll make a value type called Message or something which will be the input type for most of the module commands
  message will have things like message_text, message_html, message_sender_nick, message_sender_jid, etc
then we'll get crazy with the tests (and things will be better)

eveutils value types should be proper value types with simple constructors, but factory methods can be nearby
this will make mocking tests so much better

should be able to reply_to a message on bot - it PMs or posts to groupchat appropriately

should handle html in message text properly
